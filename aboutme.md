My name is Wesley Lamkin. I have **zero** credentials.

### I do have:
  - a strong faith in Jesus Christ that has transformed my entire existence for the better.
  - a desire to learn as much as I can while I'm on this journey called life.
  - opinions and conclusions based on sound logic.
  - a propensity to share my thoughts more often than necessary.

I don't consider myself much of a writer, but this [blog](https://kainektisis.github.io) helps me organize my thoughts and further my personal study of the world around me.  Thanks for listening!
