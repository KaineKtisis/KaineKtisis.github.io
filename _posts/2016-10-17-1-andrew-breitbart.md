> *Student:*  I just don't understand why you're saying you are for diversity, when you are making so many racial undertones about diversity.  And how racist you're being about racism.
> 
> *Breitbart:*  No offense, but you are the definition of indoctrination and you don't even understand what you're saying.
> 
> *Breitbart:*  God help us...
> 
> *Breitbart:*  I understand the language, and you're implying that I'm racist.
> 
> *Breitbart:*  You need to understand what multiculturalism is and what political correctness is.  And it is cultural Marxism.  And it is the translation of Marxist theory from, instead of the "have-s vs. the have-nots."  It didn't work in this country so they created the "oppressor vs. the oppressed."
> 
> *Breitbart:*  And the definition of racism is only white people can be racist because blacks and hispanics can't be.  That is malarky!  They have you thinking in terms of race!  They have you thinking in terms of race!  Everything is race!  There was a world before this.  The buildings that were made here were made by people who didn't graduate their colleges obsessed with race.  They learned through math.  They learned through science.
> 
> *Breitbart:*  This educational system is going to fail you!  You will not be able to invent a widget.  And you certainly won't be able to build it in this country anymore.
> 
> *Breitbart:*  I am the ultimate example.  I graduated from college believing exactly as you believe.  And I walked in from the theoretical world into the real world and realized that if I wanted to put rice on the table and pay for my rent, I'd better get out of this victimhood mentality, and I did.
> 
> *Breitbart:*  You are brainwashed to think I am a racist and you think I'm speaking in code terms.
> 
> *Breitbart:*  And I believe to the core of my being that this country will be destroyed by people like you who think you are doing good, while you divide.  You divide into separate categories that you pit against each other.  There should be no congressional black caucus.  There should be no latino caucus.  E Pluribus Unum.  E Pluribus Unum beats multiculturalism.
