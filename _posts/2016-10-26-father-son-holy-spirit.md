title: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
subtitle: Tuesday Talk 4 | Sharing What I've Received
---
In this edition of Tuesday Talk, we are going to study Scripture for the purpose of understanding how the Bible defines the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  First, we will examine the terms individually and then, as a whole.

*Note:  All Scripture cited below is quoted from the New American Standard Bible unless otherwise noted.*

## The Father

### Galatians 1:1-4
> Paul, an apostle (not sent from men nor through the agency of man, but through Jesus Christ and **God the Father**, who raised Him from the dead), and all the brethren who are with me,
> 
> To the churches of Galatia:
> 
> Grace to you and peace from **God our Father** and the Lord Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for our sins so that He might rescue us from this present evil age, according to the will of our **God and Father**, to whom be the glory forevermore. Amen.

+ "The Father" refers to God Himself.  God is the Father.

### Malachi 2:10
> Do we not all have **one father**? Has not **one God** created us? Why do we deal treacherously each against his brother so as to profane the covenant of our fathers?

### Hebrews 12:9
> Furthermore, we had **earthly fathers** to discipline us, and we respected them; shall we not much rather be subject to **the Father of spirits**, and live?

+ The Father is the Father of all creation, not just the Father of the Son.
+ Just like we all have one earthly, biological father, all of creation has one heavenly Father.

### Romans 8:14-16
> For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For you have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, “**Abba! Father!**” The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God

+ "Abba" means "father" in Aramaic, a common language spoken at the time.
+ The Father is our adoptive Father by reason of the new spiritual birth.
+ We all understand that the word "father" is a title indicating a relationship to another.  With respect to God, the title "Father" indicates His relationship to us by creation, His relationship to the Son by begetting, and His relationship to us by spiritual regeneration.

### Matthew 5:16
> Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.

### Matthew 5:45
> so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

### Matthew 5:48
> Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

+ Jesus teaches us many times that God is our Father.

### Matthew 6:9
> "Pray, then, in this way:
> 
>   'Our Father who is in heaven,
>   Hallowed be Your name.

+ Jesus teaches us to pray to our Father

### John 3:16
> For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that  whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life.

+ Jesus as a man has a unique relationship to God in that He is the only One actually conceived by the Spirit of God and the only One having the fullness of God without measure.

### Ephesians 4:6
> one God and Father of all who is over all and through all and in all.

+ Again, the Bible states that there is only one Father. (*see also* Malachi 2:10)

### Isaiah 9:6
> For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us;  
> And the government will rest on His shoulders;  
> And His name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,  
> Eternal Father, Prince of Peace.

### John 10:30
> I and the Father are one.

+ Jesus is the one Father incarnate.

### John 5:43
> I have come in My Father’s name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him.

+ Jesus said He has come in His Father's name.

### Hebrews 1:4
> having become as much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.

+ The name of the Father is Jesus; this name fully reveals and expresses the Father.
+ The Son inherited His Father's name.

### John 17:6
> I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world; they were Yours and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.
 
### John 17:26
> and I have made Your name known to them, and will make it known, so that the love with which You loved Me may be in them, and I in them.

+ Jesus said He manifested and declared His Father's name.

### Psalm 22:22
> I will tell of Your name to my brethren;  
> In the midst of the assembly I will praise You.

### Hebrews 2:12
> saying,  
>   “I will proclaim Your name to My brethren,  
>   In the midst of the congregation I will sing Your praise.”

+ Upon reading the entire chapters of Psalm 22 and Hebrews 2, you will see that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecy that states that the Messiah will declare the name of the LORD.
+ In Matthew 27:45-46, Jesus quotes Psalm 22:1 as part of this fulfillment when, on the cross, He said "My God, my God, why have You forsaken Me?"
+ Interesting to note that Psalm 22 was written about 1000 years before the crucifixion of Jesus, before crucifixion was even invented as a means of execution.
