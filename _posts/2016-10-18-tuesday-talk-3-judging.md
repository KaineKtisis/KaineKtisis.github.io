## Judging Others

In this edition of Tuesday Talk we are going to study some scriptures to find out what the Bible says about judging others.  Christians are often accused of being judgemental or hypocritical, especially by non-believers.

I think that the church (including myself), in general, as well as the rest of the world has an insufficient understanding of what the Bible says on this subject.

All of the scriptures cited below are from the *New American Standard Bible*, unless otherwise noted.

### James 4:11-12

> "Do not speak against one another, brethren.  He who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks against the law and judges the law; but if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge of it.  There is only one Lawgiver and Judge, the One who is able to save and to destroy; but who are you who judge your neighbor?"

+ In a court of law, a judge has the authority to hear and decide cases and is charged with the legal duty to administer justice, with respect to the law.  Would a judge be considered a good judge, if he himself, broke the law?  Certainly not!  Especially since he is one who should know the law best, and should equally apply the law to all in a fair and just way.

+ James says here that there is only one Lawgiver and Judge, who has the absolute power of life and death.  With respect to the Law of the Spirit, we do not have that authority.

+ We are in no position to administer His justice hypocritically or self-righteously.

### I Corinthians 4:1-5

> "Let a man regard us in this manner, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.  In this case, moreover, it is required of stewards that one be found trustworthy.  But to me it is a very small thing that I may be examined by you, or by any human court; in fact, I do not even examine myself.  For I am conscious of nothing against myself, yet I am not by this acquitted; but the one who examines me is the Lord.  Therefore do not go on passing judgment before the time, but wait until the Lord comes who will both bring to light the things hidden in the darkness and disclose the motives of men’s hearts; and then each man’s praise will come to him from God."

+ Paul makes an important point here.  As Christians, God has revealed the truth of the gospel to us.  Since we are stewards of the gospel, we must be found faithful and trustworthy to have this privilege and responsibility.

+ He continues to say that although he feels blameless, that does not necessarily acquit him before God. 

+ We as humans judge by outward appearances and evidence from our senses, such as what we see, but God is able to know the deepest secrets of a person's heart.  We are foolish when we think that we know the motivations of others. (see *Psalm 44:16*, *Proverbs 16:2*, *I Samuel 16:7*, *John 2:24-25*)

### I Corinthians 5:9-13

> "I wrote you in my letter not to associate with immoral people;  I did not at all mean with the immoral people of this world, or with the covetous and swindlers, or with idolaters, for then you would have to go out of the world.  But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler—not even to eat with such a one.  For what have I to do with judging outsiders?  Do you not judge those who are within the church?  But those who are outside, God judges.  Remove the wicked man from among yourselves."

+ The term "immoral" here is referring to sexual immorality.

+ This chapter starts off with Paul addressing a report that came to him regarding sexual immorality in the church---the kind he said doesn't even exist among the non-believers.  Paul was referring to a minister having an affair with his own father's wife.

+ Here, Paul does clearly pass judgement (to a minister in the church) calling for him to be kicked out.  As an elder apostle, this was done for the man's sake and the church's sake so that the inappropriate behavior didn't continue and influence new believers.

+ In ancient times, eating with someone was an open display of friendship and acceptance.  That's why the Pharisees asked Jesus' disciples why Jesus was eating with sinners. (see *Matthew 9:10*)

+ We see that the biblical definition of judgement refers to assuming the role of authority in administering justice from a morally superior position.  This is inappropriate to do regarding the nonbeliever.

+ Although we have no authority to judge another's heart (or motives), we must make moral distinctions with respect to judging what is right and what is wrong, but we should not be hypocrital about it.

+ Many use the argument such as "You can't tell other people what's wrong or what's right or how to live their lives."  This is in itself hypocrital because by that statement they are telling someone what is wrong and how to live.  There is a big difference between judging an action or behavior, and judging a person.  Sin has already been judged by God; the sinner hasn't.

+ Even people who have committed the worst of crimes have the opportunity to repent and be forgiven by God.

### Matthew 7:1-6

> “Do not judge so that you will not be judged.  For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.  Why do you look at the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?  Or how can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ and behold, the log is in your own eye?  You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye."
> 
> “Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not throw your pearls before swine, or they will trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you to pieces."

+ Jesus is telling us that we should not judge or criticize and condemn others unfairly with an attitude of self-righteous superiority, because we will be judged by that same standard.

+ Jesus is also telling us we need to focus on examining our own shortcomings first, and removing them, so that we can then see clearly to help others.

+ In verse 6, He warns us of the dangers of hypocrisy.  Dogs and pigs represent people that despise sacred things.  When we are hypocrites, our view of morality is destroyed.

### Galatians 6:3-5 (NIV)

> "For if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing, he deceives himself.  But each one must examine his own work, and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone, and not in regard to another.  For each one will bear his own load."

+ We see that we should not think more highly of ourselves.  We should examine our own work, without comparison to others, so that we may have a reason to be proud of our work with regard to ourselves, alone.

### Conclusion

+ God has already made righteous judgements on what is sinful and what is not.

+ We do not have the authority to pass self-righteous judgement on another, however, we do have the authority and the command to declare the Word of God, and that includes what is and what is not acceptable in the sight of the Lord.  This should be done out of love and compassion so that they may be freed from the bondage of sin, just as we are freed.

+ **REMEMBER:** You are no better than anyone else; God has just made you better off.
